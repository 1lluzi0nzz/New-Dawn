Fetcher is a natural leader, well known for taking care of his teamates and thinking through problems completely before making a calculated decision.  A city wide fire in Boston during the year 2023 had numerous fire teams scrambled to deal with the situation.  Fetcher focused on saving lives while the other teams would focus on containment.  The first apartment complex cleared was perfect. Nobody from his team of 14 people were injured and many injured civilians, as well as pets were saved.  The second complex went nearly as good aside from watching a few people not make it or lose consciousness.  Fetcher noticed that his team would be fatigued, normally he would call for assistance as additional assets would be needed to continue, however the next complex on the line was his own.  He had a wife and son locked somewhere in an already collapsing building, on the 4th story.  He recklessly ordered his team to clear the first 4 floors and leave him to get his family out.  By the time he swung open the door to his room a wave of fire jumped out at him.  He entered and saw his wife trying to scale out of the window to another building.  Realizing that the building would soon collapse he ran after them and called out, but a metal beam came down between the two and collapsed the floor.  Fetcher was pulled out of the rubble two hours later by his Aspiration teams mechanic Travis Taylor.  The individuals responsible for causing the fire were never identified.  Vowing to find the person or group responsible for his families death he leads an advanced team for the Aspiration to prevent innocent death at all costs.

	Bio:
		Dr. Naomi Kimishima is legendary amongst surgeons.  Before unwillingly joining the Providence, she had previously practiced medicine.  She was fascinated with cardiac surgery such that she would not miss an opportunity to operate on another persons heart. She rarely moved about without at least carrying minimal surgery supplies as they made her feel safe and 'clothed.' In the year 2024 a man collapsed on the streets of Beijing where she was enjoying the view from a nearby garden. Some sort of 6th sense triggered and she rushed to the scene.  Paramedics could not reach the location in time.  With the passion of saving lives, she cut into the mans chest while he was unconscious and excised a malignant tumor that had metastasized.  Upon completion of the surgery she fled the scene and went into hiding.  She was never seen in public again.  Some say they saw an entirely grey figure put her to sleep in an alleyway and take her into the distance, while the more widely accepted belief is that she fainted after the surgery and collapsed.  Shortly after she supposedly collapsed a man took her to a hospital where she was presumed dead.  Weilding new cutting edge surgical equipment along with high tech weapons given by the Providence, she pursues the new goal of establishing an equilibrium of peace amongst this now hostile Earth.
